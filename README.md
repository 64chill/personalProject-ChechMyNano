# Simple - basic android app

This app allows users to enter their Nano cryptocurrency addresses and allows them to track how much NANO they hold and enable them to see the value in Fiat currency.

This app does not function anymore as the website that was used to scrape the data from, nano balances, is not functional : https://nanoexplorer.io . At the time of writing the app it was functional and Jsoup was used to scrape the data.
